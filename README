Run like:

sourceresponse <ms> <model>

There's a simple model in the root of the project called
bright-sources.txt. Note that the model needs to be in
"ao" format, which is not the same as the bbs/dp3 format.

The output will be placed in the current working directory.
Since it will consist of several files, you might want
to create an empty directory and run from there.
